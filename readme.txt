# Remake The EternalBlue Website

You broke the EternalBlue's website, it's now up to you to make a new one.

Your task is to make a new website for EternalBlue with the same core functionality as the current one.
Creativity and improvements in how the website is built are encouraged, but are also not a necessity at all.
It's up to you to choose the best tools for the job. This means that you have a free choice of programming languages, frameworks, etc., but the choices you make should be sensible.
Your submission is judged solely on how well it fulfills the requirements of the task.

**It's important that the website has an easily maintainable and readable codebase with good coding practices, so it won't break again.**

The site should have 3 screens:
1. The first screen should have a password field and a login button. It should have a hidden input field with the first password in a ASCII format. When the user types in the correct password navigating to page 2.
2. The second screen should have a input field and a login button. It should contain the image from the EternalBlue website. When the user types in the correct password navigate to Page 3.
3. The third screen should include a title congratulating the user on logging in. It should include a download button. The download button should download the Task.md file.

If you don't want to design and style a website with HTML/CSS from scratch, then you are welcome to use our design. We essentially do not care if the user facing part is pretty :).

When the site is done, send a zip file (or a link to one, gmail doesn't always allow .zip files) of the codebase to:
